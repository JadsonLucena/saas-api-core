# api-core
Is a modular and scalable template for building modern APIs. It provides generic and reusable implementations for essential services and features required by professional-grade applications.

The goal of this project is to offer a solid, extensible foundation that can be used as a starting point for more complex architectures, adopting principles such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and best practices in security, performance, and maintainability.

## Key Objectives
 - Standardize API project structure.
 - Provide ready-to-use integrations with popular services.
 - Enable reuse of interfaces and implementations across projects.
 - Serve as a base template for new projects.
